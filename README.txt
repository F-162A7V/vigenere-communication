The purpose of this project is socket-based secure vigenere-cipher based communication with a dynamic key, 
where each message contains an (encrypted) key for the next message.


In order to secure the conversation further, the initial key is generated by a time-based algorithm on the code-side of each
socket. That way assuming somebody is listening on the first message, he would not be able to trace the keys back.




The program contains a user interface which lets the user choose the action he seeks.




Future support for: encrypted text file transfer, encrypted image transfer
